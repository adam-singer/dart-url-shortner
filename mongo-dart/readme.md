#Mongo-dart - MongoDB driver for Dart programming language.

It is a server-side library with minimalistic support of MongoDb. At the moment driver supports basic CRUD operations.

Some samples are in directory **examples**. Also Chris Buckett gave a realistic use case scenario in two part blog post:

 - [Building a client / server Dart App – Part 1 – server side](http://blog.dartwatch.com/2012/03/building-client-server-dart-app-part-1.html)
 - [Building a client / server Dart App – Part 2 – client (browser) side](http://blog.dartwatch.com/2012/03/building-client-server-dart-app-part-2.html)

Project uses libraries:

 - unittest_vm - Bygone version from dart repository
 - [log4dart](https://github.com/Qalqo/log4dart)
